# FCA: Reporting

FCA is pre-configured to generate detailed mochawesome JSON reports following the completion of [sanity tests](./Execution.md#sanity). This functionality not only provides users with immediate test results. It also enables sending these reports to AWS or any other URL endpoint for further processing and analysis. Users have the flexibility to utilize the generated mochawesome report JSON in various ways, including transforming the JSON data into an HTML report.

## Using the Existing Reporting Logic

### Background

The default reporting mechanism in FCA is designed to streamline your test analysis process. Post-execution of sanity tests, the app generates detailed mochawesome JSON. The `northBoundSchemaValidationAndReportGeneration()` function in [Test_Runner.js](../src/Test_Runner.js) orchestrates this entire process. The function returns the report data as an object. Additionally, for users leveraging `IntentReader`, the [runTestHandler](../src/pubsub/handlers/RunTestHandler.js) class can be utilized to execute a sanity test and the [getTestHandler](../src/pubsub/GetTestHandler.js) can be used to receive the generated report.

#### Standalone Mode

Furthermore, FCA supports `standalone` report generation. Standalone reporting posts to a different endpoint which allows for more diverse report management and usage.

In order to activate `standalone` mode, include the following paramaters:

- `standalone` (string: required): Set to `true` to enable standalone mode.

- `reportingId` (string: optional): string - An identifier for naming the generated report JSON file.

Parameters can be provided via intent or as URL query parameters. This mode is particularly useful for specialized report handling or when integrating with unique endpoint requirements.

### Setup

To initiate the built-in reporting, follow the preliminary steps below.

**NOTES**:

- The steps below are tailored for AWS configurations. For other platforms, adjustments will be necessary.

- `pushReportToS3()` is a versatile function that can interface with non-AWS POST endpoints to transfer your mochawesome JSON.

1. Create a POST endpoint in AWS API Gateway to accept incoming JSON.

2. Configure your endpoints in [config.js](../plugins/config.js) as follows, to set up the report publishing process:

```
REPORT_PUBLISH_URL: '', // Endpoint for standard report publishing
REPORT_PUBLISH_STANDALONE_URL: '', // Endpoint for standalone report publishing
REPORT_PUBLISH_STANDALONE_REPORT_URL: '', // Optional: Endpoint for hosting a live HTML report
```

### Usage

Initiate a sanity test run to activate the reporting function. Upon completion, FCA automatically processes and generates the mochawesome JSON report.

## Creating Your Own Reporting Logic

### Background

Enhancing FCA's reporting functionality allows for tailored insights and expanded data usage. Custom reporting might include HTML report generation for easy visualization, or integration with analytics tools for historical test performance tracking. These customizations offer deeper insights and more granular control over test data.

Consider modifying `northBoundSchemaValidationAndReportGeneration()` for custom report processing. Additionally, use [Utils.js](../src/utils/Utils.js) to include any helper reporting functions.

### Setup & Usage

Custom reporting setups will vary based on your specific requirements and the tools you integrate with. Be prepared for a unique configuration journey as you tailor FCAâ€™s reporting to your needs.

Remember, effective reporting is key to understanding and improving your application's performance. With FCA, you have the flexibility to use default settings for quick setup or delve into custom configurations for deeper data insights.
